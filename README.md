## Etch-a-sketch
The Etch-a-sketch is a web-based application that allows users to create and customize grids for drawing or pixel art. It provides an interactive interface where users can adjust the grid size, choose colors, and paint the grid cells.

## Features
Grid Creation: Users can specify the desired size of the grid, and a grid of that size will be generated on the screen.
Color Selection: Users can choose a color from the available options to paint the grid cells. They can also select the "random" option to have colors generated randomly.
Grid Interaction: When the mouse hovers over a grid cell, its color changes according to the selected color. This allows users to easily paint the cells.
Grid Reset: Users can reset the grid by clearing all the colors and restoring them to the default state.
